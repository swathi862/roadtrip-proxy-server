# Wanderlust Proxy Server
 This is a proxy server I built to access the [Mapbox Directions API](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/how-mapbox-works/directions/) for my front-end capstone project for NewForce. Instructions for how I built the proxy server can be found [here](https://github.com/BlaiseRoberts/proxy-server)!

 ## How to run this proxy server
 Run `npm start` in the project's directory in the terminal.
