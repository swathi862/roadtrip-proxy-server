# Wanderlust Proxy Server
 This is a proxy server I built to access the [Mapbox Directions API](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/how-mapbox-works/directions/) for my front-end capstone project for NewForce. Instructions for how I built the proxy server can be found [here](https://github.com/BlaiseRoberts/proxy-server)!

 ## How to run this proxy server
 + Either fork or clone down this repository. Make sure you are in the `roadtrip-proxy-server` directory in the terminal, if not, `cd` into it.
 + Run `npm start` in this project's directory in the terminal.
